The Grace Hopper conference is fast approaching, and I can barely contain my excitement! I've been working pretty hard the last few days to try and finish all my assignments, as well as get my resume updated and other UofTHacks related business sorted out so that I can enjoy my time at Grace Hopper without worrying about all the other work that needs to get done.

I've been using a ton of resources to help me get prepared, and shall now start putting those resources in a list so that anyone else that's looking will be able to find them too! These are a mixture of guides that I have found from other people, as well as general assumptions that I am making before the event. Perhaps I'll write a post after the event and see what did and didn't work.

 - The first is this [wonderful guide by Shirley Miao](https://medium.com/@shirlmeow/a-guide-to-navigating-grace-hopper-8a1e7693e37e) based on her experience at GHC 2014
 - The [Ladies Storm Hackathon](https://www.facebook.com/groups/LadiesStormHackathons/?ref=br_tf) group's, [Ladies Storm GHC](https://www.facebook.com/events/368256226701217/) group, with lots of tips!
 - Resumes? Business Cards? BOTH.
 - Have an Interview lined up (or prepping for them anyway), read this [AMA with Gayle Laakman McDowell](https://medium.com/ladies-storm-hackathons/lsh-presents-gayle-laakmann-mcdowell-4a281088c98b), the author of [Cracking the Coding Interview](http://www.amazon.ca/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/0984782850/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1444032585&sr=8-1&keywords=cracking+the+coding+interview).

That's all for now! I'll update this list with more information and tips as I get them.
